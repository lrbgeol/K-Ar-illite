# K-Ar-illite
Weighted and linear regression, end-member age calculation, and plotting tools for K/Ar illite geochronology ('illite age analysis').

This python code performs Illite-Age-Analysis, and produces a weighted least squares fit of a straight line to K-Ar illite dates of sample size separates with error in both coordinates.The code calculates the authigenic (1md) end-member illite age. It can handle bivariate regression where the errors in both coordinates are correlated and is capable of performing force-fit regression.

This code was written by Lydia Bailey (lydiabailey@fas.harvard.edu) and the regression was adapted from a MATLAB code written by Kaustubh Thirumalai of the University of Arizona.
